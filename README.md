fx is a coding agent harness and CLI written in Zig, optimized for research and embeddability as part of larger systems.

It focuses on minimalism and performance across the board, from system prompt design to its tools, feature set, and 7.8 MiB binary.

For end users, its CLI output style and form factor aim to be closer to a Unix shell than a heavy "IDE in the terminal" TUI.

It's open source (Apache-2.0), model-agnostic, and suitable for both local and cloud inference.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://fx.sh/setup.sh | bash
```

## Run fx

To get started, sign in with Vercel:

```bash
fx login
```

Or add an AI Gateway API key:

```bash
fx setup
```

Run fx from a project:

```bash
cd your_project
fx
```

The current directory becomes the primary workspace. Enter a prompt, or run `/help` to browse interactive commands.

Run `/feedback` to open the feedback form at `fx.sh/feedback`. It does not create a diagnostic or change the clipboard.

Run `/trace` to create a private Markdown diagnostic with logs, session context, runtime state, permissions, and recent activity. On macOS, fx copies the `.md` file to the clipboard; on other platforms, it saves the file and prints its path. Review and redact the trace before sharing it.

Use `fx ask` for a single request:

```bash
fx ask "explain the changes in this repository"
```

fx starts in `auto` permission mode, which reviews unresolved sensitive actions. See [Permissions](https://fx.sh/docs/configure-fx/permissions) for other modes and persistent rules.

Inside a saved session, `/permissions remember <allow|deny> <tool-name> <arguments-json>` stores an exact confirmed rule without running the action. `/permissions` lists stable rule IDs, and `/permissions revoke <rule-id>` removes a stored rule even when its original workspace or file state has changed.

## Embed fx

fx builds as a native binary or WebAssembly. Applications embedding fx can provide network transport, session storage, configuration, permission handling, and terminal I/O.

| Surface | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `fx acp` | Connect the native agent to editors and other Agent Client Protocol clients. |
| `createFxAgent()` | Embed the agent core in a JavaScript host with `fx-core.wasm`. |
| `createFxTerminal()` | Embed the interactive terminal with `fx-term.wasm`. |

The WebAssembly SDK is experimental. See the [WebAssembly SDK](sdk/README.md) and [ACP documentation](https://fx.sh/docs/using-fx/acp).

## Extend fx

Add reusable instructions with [skills](https://fx.sh/docs/capabilities/skills), connect external tools through [MCP](https://fx.sh/docs/capabilities/mcp), or delegate independent work to [subagents](https://fx.sh/docs/capabilities/subagents). Project instruction files may link within their scope, and read-only workspace or compatibility skill directories may link within their owning workspace or home; managed skills, `SKILL.md` files, resources, and escaping links remain no-follow. `fx status` and `fx doctor` report an invalid trusted MCP profile without starting its servers.

## Local OpenAI-compatible servers

This fork can talk to a local OpenAI-compatible HTTP server (vLLM, SGLang, llama.cpp) instead of Vercel AI Gateway.

Set these in the process environment. Do not commit URLs, tokens, or hostnames.

```bash
export FX_GATEWAY_PROTOCOL=openai
export FX_GATEWAY_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1
export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=replace-with-a-token-your-server-accepts
export FX_MODEL=your-model-id
export FX_AUTO_UPGRADE=0
```

`FX_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` is still loopback HTTP by default (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `[::1]`). To reach another RFC1918 address on your LAN, also set:

```bash
export FX_GATEWAY_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HTTP=1
```

That flag does not allow public HTTP origins. Prefer an SSH tunnel to loopback when you can.

In this mode fx:

- lists models from `/v1/models`
- posts chat to `/v1/chat/completions`
- rewrites Vercel `{prompt}` bodies to OpenAI `{messages}`
- reads OpenAI `chat.completion.chunk` SSE (not the Vercel UI-message stream)

Optional: `FX_GATEWAY_CHAT_URL` if your server does not use the usual `/v1/chat/completions` suffix.

## Documentation

Read the [fx documentation](https://fx.sh/docs).

## Build from source

Building fx requires [Zig 0.16.0+](https://ziglang.org/download/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mobius/fx-local-vllm.git
cd fx-local-vllm
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
./zig-out/bin/fx
```

Run the test suite with `zig build test`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development and contribution guidelines.
